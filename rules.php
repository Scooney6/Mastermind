    Goal: Guess the secret 4-digit code.

    For every guess you submit, you will get a black square if one of the colors is the correct color and in the right spot.
    You will get a white square if one of the colors is the correct color but in the wrong spot.
    You will get nothing for a color not in the secret.

    Note: The black and white squares are not in order based on your guess.

    Scoring:
    Scoring is based on the number of tries you take and the time it takes you to guess the correct code.
